                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2" target="_blank"><img src="images/rdr2.jpg"></a>
                <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favorite game because of how good the story is. I also really like the graphics and how many things there are to do in this game. You get very immersed into the lifestyle of the characters in the game, and I believe that is what makes the story so compelling.</p>

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_(TV_series)" target="_blank"><img src="images/atlShow.jpg"></a>
                <p>Atlanta is my favorite show because of its unique brand of humor, along with its very interesting plot and characters. I have been a fan of Donald Glover for a while, and he is a very big part of the show, so I knew it would be great from the jump. </p>

                <p>Cats are dope and super cuddly. Mine smacks me sometimes which isn't cool, but its okay because he is cute. </p>
